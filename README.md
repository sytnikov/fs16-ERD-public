## Design ERD to your REST APIs

- Library management system: books, users, and authors
- E-commerce: Products, Users, and Order

Please, refer to the REST API slides for further information regarding the basic requirements.

Do keep in mind that:
- This is team work 
- The properties and entities we are suggesting are just basic ones; feel free to add more.

Assignment delivery:

1. Share an image of your ERD
2. Or share a link to an online playground

PS: Do some research to know what your system could have from entities and properties.
